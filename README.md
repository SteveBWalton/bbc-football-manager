# BBC Football Manager
Convertion of my BBC Basic Football Manager program into Python.
I wrote the original BBC Basic version between 1982 and 1989.
In 2000, I made changes to allow the program to work on BeebEm under Windows.
In 2018, I converted the program to Python with the intention that the program be a console program that would work under Linux and Windows.
