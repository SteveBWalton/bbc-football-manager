# BBC Football Manager
Conversion of my BBC Basic Football Manager program into Python.
I wrote the original BBC Basic version between 1982 and 1989.
In 2000, I made changes to allow the program to work on BeebEm under Windows.

In 2018, I started converting the program to Python with the intention that the program be a console program that would work under Linux and Windows.
Currently, just trying to get it working under Linux.  
Try to add Windows support later.
Try to add support for running in a web browser. That should work under Linux and Windows.
